# 🚀 Backend Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Backend Learning Repository**! 🎯  
This repo contains my step-by-step learning and practice with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Authentication, and other backend concepts**.  

---

## 🌟 Features

- **100% JavaScript**: All code and examples are written in JavaScript, making it accessible for Node.js and modern backend frameworks.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Hands-on mini-projects and real-world applications to reinforce backend concepts.
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrates RESTful API design, authentication, error handling, and scalability.
- **Clean Code**: Follows industry-standard code style, organization, and documentation for maintainability.
- **Modular Structure**: Each topic or project is organized in its own folder for easy navigation.
